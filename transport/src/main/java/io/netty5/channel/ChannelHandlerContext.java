/**
 * Enables a {@link ChannelHandler} to interact with its {@link ChannelPipeline}
 * and other handlers. Among other things a handler can notify the next {@link ChannelHandler} in the
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} as well as modify the {@link ChannelPipeline} it belongs to dynamically.
 *
 * <h3>Notify</h3>
 *
 * You can notify the closest handler in the same {@link ChannelPipeline} by calling one of the various methods
 * provided here.
 * Please refer to {@link ChannelPipeline} to understand how an event flows.
 *
 * <h3>Modifying a pipeline</h3>
 *
 * You can get the {@link ChannelPipeline} your handler belongs to by calling
 * {@link #pipeline()}. A non-trivial application could insert, remove, or
 * replace handlers in the pipeline dynamically at runtime.
 *
 * <h3>Retrieving for later use</h3>
 *
 * You can keep the {@link ChannelHandlerContext} for later use, such as
 * triggering an event outside the handler methods, even from a different thread.
 * <pre>
 * public class MyHandler extends {@link ChannelHandler} {
 *
 *     <b>private {@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx;</b>
 *
 *     public void handlerAdded({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx) {
 *         <b>this.ctx = ctx;</b>
 *     }
 *
 *     public void login(String username, password) {
 *         ctx.write(new LoginMessage(username, password));
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>A handler can have more than one context</h3>
 *
 * Please note that a {@link ChannelHandler} instance can be added to more than
 * one {@link ChannelPipeline}.  It means a single {@link ChannelHandler}
 * instance can have more than one {@link ChannelHandlerContext} and therefore
 * the single instance can be invoked with different
 * {@link ChannelHandlerContext}s if it is added to one or more
 * {@link ChannelPipeline}s more than once.
 *
 * <h3>Additional resources worth reading</h3>
 * <p>
 * Please refer to the {@link ChannelHandler}, and
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} to find out more about inbound and outbound operations,
 * what fundamental differences they have, how they flow in a  pipeline,  and how to handle
 * the operation in your application.
