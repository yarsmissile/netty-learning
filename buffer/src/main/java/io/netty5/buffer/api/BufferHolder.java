/**
 * The {@link BufferHolder} is an abstract class that simplifies the implementation of objects that themselves contain
 * a {@link Buffer} instance.
 * <p>
 * The {@link BufferHolder} can only hold on to a single buffer, so objects and classes that need to hold on to multiple
 * buffers will have to do their implementation from scratch, though they can use the code of the {@link BufferHolder}
 * as inspiration. Alternatively, multiple buffers can be
 * {@linkplain BufferAllocator#compose(Iterable) composed} into a single buffer, which can then be put
 * in a buffer holder.
 * <p>
 * If you just want an object that is a reference to a buffer, then the {@link BufferRef} can be used for that purpose.
 * If you have an advanced use case where you wish to implement {@link Resource}, and tightly control lifetimes, then
 * {@link ResourceSupport} can be of help.
 *
 * @param <T> The concrete {@link BufferHolder} type.
